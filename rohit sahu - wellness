Wellness are the way our bodies communicate and let us know what is going on and where we need to change our thinking. Every sickness is first an idea or feeling we hold. All of us generate and repress negative thoughts and emotions, and these can cause physical pain and symptoms of disease. The real truth about disease is that there really is nothing to heal but a false belief. Drop this false belief and the disease disappears.
